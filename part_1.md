--------------------------

Welcome back again where it all began

Open are the ports. Services all started.

Knock at every door and grab the missing strings

Put them in a row and crack the code to win



Scanning close the files may reveal some things

Data you can't hear. Data you can't see.

Scattered are the clues all around the disk

Some are in plain sight some you need to think



Check your mail for messages, log on IRC

Feeling old already? Oh I bet you did.

You will need some tools, look around for hacks

Talk with all the daemons hiding in the dark



Now don't be afraid. It's a simple game.

All you need are memories buried in your brain

For it's in the past where you need to start

Surfing like a pirate. I wish you good luck.
